## This is theHarvester as you know and love it. This notebook will work on mobile devices including phones and tablets. This will also save you a fair amount of cycles so you can use them on something else.



-Only the non-api sources are included

-If you would like to change flags you can easily update the code. It is relatively self explanatory if you are familiar with the tool.

## Have a good one, and use this wisely.
